# OpenCider Weekend Code Challenge #1

## Introduction

Welcome to the very first OpenCider API Weekend Code Challenge! Your task, should you choose to accept it, is quite simple - develop an app or game that uses OpenCider APIs. 
The goal is to build immersive experiences for your human users. 
<br>


## Exercise 

Build an intuitive and immersive experience using your medium of choice (web app or game ideally). This project must use OpenCider APIs in some way. You will be graded on how extensively you use the APIs and how much of an immersive experience you create i.e. no dull and uncreative apps. We want to encourage out-of-the-box developers with this exercise. If that is you, welcome aboard!
<br>

## Rules

Your solutions will be graded on the following metrics:

- How immersive and intuitive your experiences are. People want to get lost in worlds. Whether a POC or a WIP, how much are you able to paint the picture?
- How extensive our APIs are used.  OpenCider provides authentication, user management, summary data (think session based firestore), leaderboard, and friends functionality so the more you can use, the better.
- How simple are your solutions. Nobody wants something they need a college degree to understand. Whether conceptually or codewise, Keep It Simple, Stupid.
- Work Progress. You can submit proof-of-concepts, work-in-progress solutions but you can't submit something that has been deployed already.
<br>

## How to Submit

To submit your solution, we need the following:

- Link to a running version of your web app or demo vid for your game.
- Create a fork of this repository and commit all your changes there. Also include details of how to run it in this [file](./INSTALL.md).

Submit all these in the link here: [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfnw6bT-68bywlK06829Olpldf8gdl7pUBCMaHqgQEopmBdRQ/viewform?usp=sharing&ouid=111331855533324077144)

Important Note - Once you submit your solution, you cannot push changes as this will lead to a disqualification.

## Rewards

The winner will receive a $50 Amazon gift card and 5,000 build credits. The first 50 submissions will receive our limited first-edition NFTs.
Feel free to submit your solutions as long as they meet the criteria. Whether they are Single-Page Applications or Work-In-Progress apps or games. All are welcome - and may the odds be ever in your favour!
